Note:

1. The HTML part of the program is given as a template.  You have to write the jQuery script only  in the 'script.js' file.

2. The background color of the table caption and odd rows of the table should be 'light blue' and even rows of the table should be 'light pink'.  Observe the above table image for more details.

3. Avoid writing the jQuery 'document ready' method for the proper web page visibility.

4. Do not use 'ES6' features.
