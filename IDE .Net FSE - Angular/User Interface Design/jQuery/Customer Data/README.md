### Customer Data

Create a web page that contains two text boxes to get the name and emailaddress of the customers. When you click the Add Customer Details button, theentered data get appended to the table below that and when you click the DeleteCustomer Details button, the selected row/rows in the table (using check box)should get deleted dynamically using jQuery. 

Hint: You can use the jQuery .append() method to append or add rows inside a HTML table. Similarly, you can use the .remove() method to remove or delete table rows as well as all everything inside it from the DOM dynamically with jQuery.

Note:

- Do not alter the given 'customer.html' file.  Write your jQuery code in the file 'customer.js'.
- Avoid writing the jQuery 'document ready' method for the proper web page visibility.
- Do not use 'ES6' features.
