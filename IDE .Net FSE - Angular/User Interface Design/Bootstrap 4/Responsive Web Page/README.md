Key Points:

1.  Add responsive features to the navigation bar.  The collapsing nature is tripped by a button with the id 'btn-id' belongs to Bootstrap-4  navbar toggler  class and then features two data elements: data toggle with 'collapse' value and data target. Set appropriate value for data-target attribute. The id of collapsible content is "newNavbar".  

2. Inside the above-mentioned button tag, create a span tag with Bootstrap-4 class navbar toggler icon for creating a toggler-icon with three bars (hamburger button). 

3. Use Bootstrap-4 classes for responsive image and  rounded circle to make the image responsive, so that, it can automatically adjust to fit the size of the screen. (Please refer to the sample screen)


Note:
The web page 'responsive.html' template is given.  You have to write the code only in the specified part of the 'responsive.html' file.
