Key pointsto be noted:

1. Create a three-column layout for the web page for small devices.
2. Layout should contain a row with three columns divided in a 1:4:1 ratio for the smalldevices.
3. Column 1 and 3 should belong to the Bootstrap's side navigation class of a <div> tag with the id 'col1' and 'col3'. set the class as: 'col-sm-2' and 'sidenav' respectively. (classes should be in the same order specified.)
4. In column 2, the text should be left-aligned, use the appropriate class for the div tagwith id 'col2'.
5. Thefooter of the web page should be Bootstrap's fluid container with centered text.

Note:

Some of the components of the webpage are already been created.  You have to write the code only for theparts (for column1, column 2, column3, and footer except for the text content) that are mentioned in the template.
